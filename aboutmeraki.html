      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Meraki was founded with the vision of creating a bridge between fashion and social impact. What started as a small initiative has grown into a full-fledged social enterprise, dedicated to upcycling donated clothing and transforming them into unique, fashion-forward designs. At Meraki, we believe that fashion can be a powerful tool for change — not just a means of expression, but also a vehicle for environmental sustainability and social upliftment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our team is passionate about reducing waste, using sustainable materials, and encouraging mindful consumption. By focusing on upcycled fabrics, recycled materials, and eco-conscious production techniques, Meraki is committed to building a future where fashion and sustainability go hand in hand.
      </p>
      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>
        At Meraki, our mission is simple yet profound: to put soul, creativity, and love into everything we do. The word “Meraki” comes from Greek, meaning to do something with all your heart and effort. For us, this means creating fashion with purpose, empowering individuals, and promoting sustainable living.

        Our mission goes beyond producing beautiful clothing; it’s about fostering a sense of community and offering second chances. We are committed to sustainability, using eco-friendly materials, and ensuring that every item we create has a minimal environmental footprint. More than that, our social enterprise is dedicated to providing meaningful employment to marginalized populations, particularly individuals transitioning out of homelessness. Through skills training in design, tailoring, and fashion production, we help our employees gain confidence, build new careers, and take control of their future.
